Project: Intelligent API Rate-Limit Engine
Day 1:
- Understood rate limiting fundamentals
- Designed system architecture
- Defined decision model & enforcement strategy
- Planned demo app integration

Day 2:
- Understood Sliding window logic
- Behavior profiling
- Thread-safety basics

Day 3:
- Adding Decision Engine
- Using multiple signals to analyse the risk
- Why not ML
    -> Deterministic logic
    -> Debuggable
    -> Safer for enforcement
    -> Easier to reason about in interviews

Day 4:
- Behavior tracking
- Risk-based decisions
- Time-based blocking
- Clean separation of concerns
